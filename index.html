      <h3>OpenGL Font Map Rendering | <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/JcMN/C-FontMap-OpenGL-Assignment">GitHub</a></h3>
      <p class="sub-header">Class work - January 2025</p>
      <p>
        Developed a text rendering system using Font Maps at my final year of university, built on top of a basic engine called Wolf provided in class.
        Created 3 classes Font, TextBox and TextTable to manage the text rendering system. Implemented a system In the Font class to read XML files to 
        obtain the information for the font map. Made the TextTable to read a CSV file with the pre created strings to be used. Added dynamic replacement
        for the strings and both vertical and horizontal allignment. Project made with OpenGL, C++ and pugiXML.

      <h3>Grocery Keeper Mobile Application for Android | <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/UPEI-Android/cs3130-2023-groupprojects-shovelwaresquad">GitHub</a></h3>
      <p class="sub-header">Class Project - Android Application - Januray 2023 -  April 2023</p>
      <p>
        Developed an Android application with a team of 3 using GitHub to plan the project. The app tracks a user generated gorecery list and offers the locations
        of any sales or best prices of the items based on price comparisons. It is made using Dart, Flutter and SQLite for storing the lists and a a web scrapper to 
        scrap the information from the websites. I contributed mainly the database, the lists logic, the dark mode toggle, colour choices and ironing out bugs.

      <h3>OpenGL Scene Culling | <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/JcMN/C--Frustum-and-Space-Culling">GitHub</a></h3>
      <p class="sub-header">Class work - January 2025 - February 2025</p>
      <p>
        Developed a Scene that has both frustum and space culling via a quadtree at my final year of university, built on top of a basic engine called Wolf 
        provided in class. Everything works on node system with nodes extending to any object in theory, while for the example only cubes and the camera extend
        nodes. Both the frustum and space culling work perfectly and cull any object not seen. Currently only spheres bounding volumes work ut boxes are planned.
